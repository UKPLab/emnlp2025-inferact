You have two tasks:
1. Identify whether the trajectory has completed each task or not.
2. If it has completed the task, give a probability (ranging from 0.0 to 1.0) that indicates the task is **correctly completed**. If it has not completed the task, give a probability (ranging from 0.0 to 1.0) that indicates the trajectory is **correctly progressing towards the completion of the task**.
